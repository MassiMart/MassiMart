## Hi there 👋
🌍I am a PhD student a the department of Atmospheric Physics, Charles University in Prague (Czech Republic). \
\
☀️ I'm currently working on the investigation of Orographic Gravity Waves by applying Lagrangian Particle Dispersion Models \
\
📚 My research interests are: Dispersion modelling, Lagrangian modelling, meteorological events and dispersionon complex terrain, orographic gravity waves, stratosphere-troposphere exchange,
   atmospheric rivers identification and tracking.
