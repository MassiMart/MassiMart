## Hi there 👋
I am a PhD student a the department of Atmospheric Physics, Charles University in Prague (Czech Republic).
☀️ I'm currently working on applying Lagrangian Particle Dispersion Model (e.g. FLEXPART-WRF) for the investigation of Orographic Gravity Waves.
📚 My research interests are: Dispersion modelling, Lagrangian modelling, meteorological events and dispersionon complex terrain, orographic gravity waves, stratosphere-troposphere exchange,
atmospheric rivers identification and tracking.
